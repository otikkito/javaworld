Abstract Data types
-"The implementation details can be changed without altering the ADT interface." [1]
-This is accomplished by creating 3 different files.
->"One to hold the type and constand definitions." [1]
->"One to hold the prototypes of the functions in the ADT's (public) interface." [1]
->"One to hold the implementations of the public and private functions." [1]
